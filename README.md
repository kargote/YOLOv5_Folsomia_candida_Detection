## Project Overview

- Trained YOLOv5 model on a dataset of 200 images containing 9,498 annotated individuals of *Folsomia candida*.
- Compared different YOLOv5 model variants and input resolutions.
- Selected the best-performing model: YOLOv5l with 1280 px input resolution (`best_1280px_v5l.pt`).
- Provided scripts for training, evaluation, inference, and result visualization.

## Repository Structure
 
This repository contains only the code necessary for training and inference.

Main folders and files:
/yolov5_forked       # Complete YOLOv5 codebase (training, detection, segment, utils)
/poids               # Placeholder folder where trained weights (e.g., best_1280px_v5l.pt) can be placed
/data                # Configuration files for datasets (paths, classes)
/utils               # Custom helper functions
requirements.txt     # List of Python dependencies
train.py             # Training entry point
detect.py            # Inference script
val.py               # Evaluation script

Additional files such as model comparisons, training data, and detection results are available on Figshare:

## Installation

It is recommended to create a new Python virtual environment:

python -m venv yolov5-env
source yolov5-env/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
.\yolov5-env\Scripts\activate   # Windows

Install the required packages with:
pip install -r requirements.txt
The requirements.txt includes all dependencies needed to run training, inference, and evaluation scripts.

##  Usage

Training: Modify and run the training scripts in /yolov5_forked to retrain or fine-tune models.
Inference: Use provided inference scripts with best_1280px_v5l.pt weights to detect and count Folsomia candida in new images.
Evaluation: Scripts generate detection statistics and bounding box visualizations.
